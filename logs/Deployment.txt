Containerized staging environment (Docker Compose with Flask and MySQL

AWS or Azure
    both have similar options


    put WAF in front of app (for azure, not sure about aws)
    set up virtual network and subnets to lock down the access (in azure/aws)
    Azure WAF would be public entrance to the app
    use Azure MySQL to host DB?
        within same VNet (and maybe same subnet or diff subnet with communication to apps subnet))
        backend would need to use Azure keyvault to store connection string for DB comms

    can use azure web apps to host app in azure (look up AppService - web app for containers on azure)


    should get free credit on azure as a student

Further research: look into managed identires vs service principles
Chat GPT can most likely help set up VNet, subnet, WAF, etc.
